# Multi-Step-Household-Power-Consumption-Forecasting
Developing a highly accurate predictive model to forecast household power consumption using hybrid approaches.
->Analyzing huge volumes of its historical multivariate time-stamped data and the critical features defined in the dataset. 
->Discovered the limitation of directly using traditional & various supervised algorithms in this area of interest. 
->Improvising it by creating a model using a hybrid deep learning-based framework combining CNN with LSTMs.
